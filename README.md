# IRIS_species_classification

In this repo, we have created a classification model that is trained on the famous IRIS dataset and predicts the species when the required parameters are passed i.e. 	sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length & petal_width.

As per the evaluation metrics the trained model is 100% accurate in predicting the species and that can be found in the IRIS_Dataset.ipynb

While this repo will show you how to create a classifcation model, it will also show you how to do a K-Fold cross validation on different models to find out the best performing model. Along with that, we will also see different visualizations that helps us with Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis. 

Let's look at some of the visualizations,
